Description: framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)
 OpenCog is a framework for developing AI systems, especially appropriate for
 integrative multi-algorithm systems, and artificial general intelligence
 systems. Though much work remains to be done, it currently contains a
 functional core framework, and a number of cognitive agents at varying
 levels of completion, some already displaying interesting and useful
 functionalities alone and in combination.
