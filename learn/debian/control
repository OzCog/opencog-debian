Description: OpenCog Neuro-symbolic interpretation learning
 The goal of this project is to create a system that is capable of learning
 the grammar and some of the semantics of natural language. The fundamental
 goal is to do this in an unsupervised fashion, with no training data beyond
 that of un-annotated raw text.
