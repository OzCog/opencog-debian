Description: Meta-Optimizing Semantic Evolutionary Search
 MOSES is a machine-learning tool; it is an "evolutionary program learner".
 It is capable of learning short programs that capture patterns in input
 datasets. These programs can be output in either the combo programming
 language, or in python. For a given data input, the programs will roughly
 recreate the dataset on which they were trained.
