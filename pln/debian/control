Description: OpenCog Probabilistic Logic Network
 Probabilistic Logic Network, or PLN for short, is a logic invented by
 Ben Goertzel et al for common sense reasoning. It is particulaly well
 suited for uncertain reasoning, especially when knowledge is based on limited
 observations from reality, but can also handle abstract mathematical
 reasoning, and the relationship between the two.
 .
 To handle uncertainty PLN represents truth as a second order distribution,
 i.e. a probabilistic distribution over probabilistic distributions. Doing so
 allows one to capture uncertainty while remaining in the well known and
 proven framework of probability theory.
