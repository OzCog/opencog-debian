Description: OpenCog hypergraph database, query system and rule engine
 The OpenCog AtomSpace is a knowledge representation (KR) database and
 the associated query/reasoning engine to fetch and manipulate that data,
 and perform reasoning on it. Data is represented in the form of graphs, and
 more generally, as hypergraphs; thus the AtomSpace is a kind of graph
 database, the query engine is a general graph re-writing system, and
 the rule-engine is a generalized rule-driven inferencing system.
 The vertices and edges of a graph, known as "Atoms", are used to represent
 not only "data", but also "procedures"; thus, many graphs are executable
 programs as well as data structures.
